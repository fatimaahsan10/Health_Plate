# Healthy Plate: Nutrition Advisor 

A simple prototype that predicts whether a meal/dish is "Balanced" or "Unbalanced" based on nutrition values.
This is a hackathon prototype: labels are created with heuristic rules.

## How it works
-Enter all the required values that app will ask.
-Click submit.
-View results: app will tell wheather you have balanced diet or not

## Notes
- Labels are heuristic and for demo use only. Improve by using proper dietician rules and real labeled meal datasets.
- Not a medical tool â€” for informational/demo purposes only.
